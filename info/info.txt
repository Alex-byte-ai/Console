Command-Line parsing rules:
	Whitespace delimiters:
		Arguments are separated by spaces or tabs.
	Quoting:
		Double quotes (") are used to include spaces or special characters within a single argument.
		Example: "file name.txt" is treated as one argument.
	Escaping quotes:
		A backslash (\) preceding a quote (") escapes the quote.
		Example: \" is treated as a literal quote.
	Backslashes:
		Backslashes are treated as literal characters unless followed by a quote (").
		The number of consecutive backslashes affects parsing:
			Even number: Escapes half the backslashes, treating the remaining as literal.
			Odd number: Escapes half the backslashes and the quote.
